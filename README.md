   3 Silly Sally 22  - I'd like to see a place for once keep their daily/weekly special updated. there's nothing worse than going to    a place and you look on their site and you were wanting their chicken noodle soup and instead have tomato.
   1 James Jones 20  - I hope your website looks good on a cell phone. it sucks when you can't read the whole menu because it's over    the edge of the phone.
