Stories/objectives
   1 Matters Mike 46 - I need a tab or link to see the address and  hours of operation so I can arrive accordingly.
   4  George Ghost 29 - I would like to see a menu with detailed descriptions so I can see if I'm allergic to anything inside a dish.
   3 Rick Rush 37 -is there a link that will allow me to see a togo menu. I'm usually on the run and I like to see a togo menu on my    phone.
   3 Silly Sally 22  - I'd like to see a place for once keep their daily/weekly special updated. there's nothing worse than going to    a place and you look on their site and you were wanting their chicken noodle soup and instead have tomato.
   1 James Jones 20  - I hope your website looks good on a cell phone. it sucks when you can't read the whole menu because it's over    the edge of the phone.
   4 Pattsey Petterson 26- Will I be able to pay online so I don't have to wait in the restaurant just pay and be on my way.
   5  Matt Wayne 67 -should be a page so I can make  reservations
   2  Brett Bothers 52 - How about a page where I can see the video advertisements so I can see examples of dishes and I think they're funny.
